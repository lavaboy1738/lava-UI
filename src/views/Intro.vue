        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I wrote Lava UI for study purposes. It's a UI library based on Vue 3 and Typescript.</p>
        <p>As for the name, I've been using the handle "lavaboy1738" for a while, so might as well call it "Lava UI"</p>
        <p>The process of writing this UI library was a great learning experience for me. 
            I've been building projects with React.js in the past several months and I needed to do some reviews. 
            All the design and implementation decisions are made based on my experience as a web developer. 
            Everything was written by myself, including this documentation website, and I tried to avoid using other libraries and dependencies as much as I could. 
            <strong>Therefore, I don't really recommend using this UI library in production.</strong></p>
            <p>However, if you wanted to checkout the source code, then you're most definitely in the right place.</p>
        <p>All the source code is stored in a public repository, <strong>here's the link: https://github.com/lavaboy1738/lava-UI</strong></p>
